FilePanel Package

Contains template scene objects that allow user to immidiately have access to a highly customizable file panel.

When opened the user may select various options, including warnings on file-overwrites or current progress loss, to handle saving and loading games.

The preFab that all the controls the file panel contains may be modified, and is really just meant to be a starting template for your own UI.

Dependancies:
This package depends upon the *LimitedObjectScrollList Package* to display, potetially, many thousands of file-system entries in a scroll list, efficiently.
